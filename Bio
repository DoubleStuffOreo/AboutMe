I'm Kyla Mae Salonga. I was born in the 5th of October 1999. I grew up in Agoo, La Union. From 1st Grade to Senior High School, I studied in Don Mariano Marcos Memorial State University-South La Union Campus-Laboratory High School. Eventually, I decided to go to Manila to study Electronics Engineering in the University of Santo Tomas.

I play piano and guitar (but I'm not really that good in playing it hehe). I love reading books especially those with Young Adult and fantasy genres (Harry Potter is my ultimate favorite <3).
